# Forest Text Adventure
This is a a re-built version of a text adventure game I made in 2017. The original was coded in Python at summer camp.

# Building From Source
The game can be built using Haxe 3.2.1, OpenFL 3.6.0, and Lime 2.9.0
> OpenFL 3.6.1 and Lime 2.9.1 can be used on Windows, but will cause a crash on Mac and Linux

# Precompiled Binaries
Precompiled binaries are available from the **Releases** section.

# Project Files
The included project files are for FlashDevelop/HaxeDevelop version 5.3.3.
